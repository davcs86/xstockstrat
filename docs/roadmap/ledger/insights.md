# SDD Ledger — Insights

Cross-feature memory of **patterns that worked**: a reusable approach, a clean abstraction, an
ordering that paid off, a perf win. This is the durable, cross-feature complement to per-feature
`context.md` (which is scoped to one feature) and the persistent complement to the `dry-reviewer`
agent (which finds duplication live but records nothing).

**Read** at the front of the pipeline — `/sdd-story` (boot), `/sdd-design` (recon + grilling),
`/sdd-spec` (governance read) — so a new feature reuses what already worked.
**Written** by `/sdd-execute` at integration / ALL-DONE when a step surfaced a pattern worth
reusing.

## Rules

- **Append-only.** Add new entries at the bottom; never rewrite or delete an existing one.
- **One entry, one lesson.** Keep it scannable.
- **Cite evidence.** Point to a `path:line`, PR, or step so the reader can see the real thing.
- **Categories:** `reuse` · `perf` · `design` · `ordering`.

## Schema

```markdown
### <ISO date> — <feature-slug> — <category>
- **Pattern**: <what worked and why it's reusable>
- **Evidence**: <path:line or PR/step ref>
- **Rule it implies**: <one line; if it should become binding, propose a Constitution ID>
```

### 2026-07-08 — backtest-debug-info — design
- **Pattern**: To add a per-bar/observability read to an engine consumed by a live loop, keep the
  hot method's return type frozen and add a sibling (`evaluate_with_series()` beside `evaluate()`),
  the wrapped one delegating — protects mocking tests and the feature-048 caller from a blast-radius
  change while surfacing the extra data.
- **Evidence**: `services/xstockstrat-analysis/app/services/evaluator.py:74`; caller `app/engine/live_loop.py:119`; design.md § Chosen Approach.
- **Rule it implies**: prefer an additive sibling over widening a shared return contract (reinforces C-04/P-03; no new ID needed).
