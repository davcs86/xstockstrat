# SDD Ledger — Insights

Cross-feature memory of **patterns that worked**: a reusable approach, a clean abstraction, an
ordering that paid off, a perf win. This is the durable, cross-feature complement to per-feature
`context.md` (which is scoped to one feature) and the persistent complement to the `dry-reviewer`
agent (which finds duplication live but records nothing).

**Read** at the front of the pipeline — `/sdd-story` (boot), `/sdd-design` (recon + grilling),
`/sdd-spec` (governance read) — so a new feature reuses what already worked.
**Written** by `/sdd-execute` at integration / ALL-DONE when a step surfaced a pattern worth
reusing.

## Rules

- **Append-only.** Add new entries at the bottom; never rewrite or delete an existing one.
- **One entry, one lesson.** Keep it scannable.
- **Cite evidence.** Point to a `path:line`, PR, or step so the reader can see the real thing.
- **Categories:** `reuse` · `perf` · `design` · `ordering`.

## Schema

```markdown
### <ISO date> — <feature-slug> — <category>
- **Pattern**: <what worked and why it's reusable>
- **Evidence**: <path:line or PR/step ref>
- **Rule it implies**: <one line; if it should become binding, propose a Constitution ID>
```

### 2026-07-03 — persist-strategy-scores — design
- **Pattern**: To add DB durability to volatile in-memory service state without changing (and risking)
  the read path, use **write-through + hydrate-at-boot**: keep the in-memory dict as the sole read
  source, add a best-effort DB upsert on write, and hydrate the dict from the DB once at startup. Avoids
  the false-success hazard of "best-effort write + read-from-DB" (a swallowed write then a DB read →
  NOT_FOUND for a value the caller was just told succeeded).
- **Evidence**: `services/xstockstrat-analysis/app/handlers/servicer.py` (`hydrate_scores`, best-effort
  upsert in `ScoreStrategy`), `app/main.py` boot call; design.md § Chosen Approach (feature 064).
- **Rule it implies**: prefer write-through+hydrate over DB-direct reads when a best-effort write and a
  durable read path must coexist; reuse the existing repo/pool (no new pool — F-06).
