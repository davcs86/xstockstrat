# SDD Ledger — Fails

Cross-feature memory of **mistakes that recurred**: a wrong assumption, a duplication that slipped
through, a migration/config/header misstep, scope creep. The point is to stop the *same* mistake
from happening a third time — a recurring entry here is a candidate for promotion into a binding
Constitution rule (`docs/sdd/constitution.md`).

**Read** at the front of the pipeline — `/sdd-story` (boot), `/sdd-design` (recon grounds risks;
the grilling adversary cites past fails), `/sdd-spec` (governance read) — so a new feature avoids a
known trap.
**Written** by `/sdd-execute` at deviation-handling when a deviation reveals a mistake that has (or
could) recur. This is the durable arm of Constitution **P-03** (no silent deviation — a recurring
ambiguity is logged here).

## Rules

- **Append-only.** Add new entries at the bottom; never rewrite or delete an existing one.
- **One entry, one mistake.** Keep it scannable.
- **Cite evidence.** Point to the deviation, `path:line`, PR, or step.
- **Categories:** `assumption` · `duplication` · `migration` · `config` · `header` · `scope-creep`.

## Schema

```markdown
### <ISO date> — <feature-slug> — <category>
- **Mistake**: <what went wrong and how it recurred>
- **Evidence**: <path:line or PR/step/deviation ref>
- **Rule it implies**: <one line; if it should become binding, propose a Constitution ID>
```
