## Session 2026-05-28T00:00:00Z — sdd-story

- Surveyed all three Next.js frontends (xstockstrat-trader, xstockstrat-insights, xstockstrat-config-ui).
- Confirmed all three already use SWR 2.2.5 — library choice is SWR (not react-query).
- Found 43 / 19 / 17 `any` occurrences respectively; main sources: `{} as any` in service descriptor placeholders (`connectClients.ts`, `configClient.ts`), `catch (err: any)`, and untyped response destructuring in components.
- Generated stubs at `packages/proto/gen/ts/` are intentionally not imported in frontends (bundle size concern noted in code comments); spec preserves this decision — typed interfaces are hand-authored from the Connect-RPC JSON shapes.
- config-ui uses a flat directory structure (no `src/`); noted in Out of Scope and Affected Services.
- Created feature.md (status: draft), product-spec.md, context.md from user story.
