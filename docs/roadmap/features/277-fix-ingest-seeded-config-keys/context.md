## Session 2026-10-22 (/sdd-triage)

- Bug reported via defect report `docs/reports/2026-10-22-ingest-seeded-config-keys-never-read-defect.md` (Issues disabled)
- Severity: SEV-3, environment dev (staging) → Track C
- Created: feature.md, product-spec.md, acceptance.feature (regression scenarios), context.md
- Affected services (from report): xstockstrat-ingest, xstockstrat-config
- Root cause hypothesis: mixed seed key convention; ingest seeds are namespace-stripped, readers use the dotted form
- Recommended design depth: full → `/sdd-design fix-ingest-seeded-config-keys` (rationale: two services, a config key change or migration, and an open platform-wide sweep)
- Development branch: feature/fix-ingest-seeded-config-keys
- The runtime effect (reads miss the snapshot) is inferred from code and the live key registry, not observed; the design must confirm it with a live `set_config` check on staging before choosing the fix shape.
- Open questions for design: re-key seeds vs change readers; handling of operator-edited rows on re-key; whether other namespaces' older bare seeds are also inert; INGEST-9 wording; whether the unseeded `max_concurrent_jobs` and `retry_on_failure` keys should be seeded.
