## Summary

Add a DB-backed signal source registry to the ingest service that defines all valid sources, their types (simple_email, email_attachment, linked_email, simple_website, authenticated_website), and per-source Python extractor modules. The registry enforces canonical source slugs across ingest and analysis, and is a prerequisite for the AI agent feature and signal-source-weighting (007).

## Reviewers

_(Snapshot finalized by /sdd-spec on 2026-05-21. Re-run /sdd-spec if the registry changes.)_

| Role | Review Focus |
|---|---|
| `xstockstrat-ingest` owner | Signal normalization correctness, idempotent ingestion, newsletter source schema stability |
| `xstockstrat-config-ui` owner | Config mutation safety, environment scope correctness, no secret values rendered in UI |
| Proto Reviewer | Field number uniqueness, no breaking changes without deprecation, `buf lint` passes |
| DBA | Migration NNN numbering, up+down pair present, JSONB column strategy, index correctness |
| Security | credentials_ref never in responses, admin auth scope on ManageSignalSource, secret.* prefix enforced |

## Next Action

`/sdd-execute signal-source-registry` — implementation spec reviewed and ready for execution
