## Session 2026-11-10 (/sdd-triage)

- Bug reported via defect reports (Issues disabled; clustered triage):
  - `docs/reports/2026-10-19-sandbox-exit-reason-stderr-substring-defect.md` — sandbox exit reason classified by stderr substring match (SEV-3)
  - `docs/reports/2026-10-19-sandbox-memory-used-bytes-always-zero-defect.md` — SandboxResult.memory_used_bytes always zero (SEV-3)
  - `docs/reports/2026-10-22-indicators-missing-result-silent-success-defect.md` — formula that never assigns result returns success with empty output (SEV-2)
- Cluster rationale: all three are the sandbox child-wrapper → parent result contract in `app/services/sandbox.py`; a structural child report fixes classification, measurement and missing-result together.
- Severity: SEV-2 (highest of the cluster)
- Routed to SDD path (Track C)
- Created: status.md, feature.md, product-spec.md, acceptance.feature (3 regression scenarios), context.md; report sidecars stamped `triaged`
- Affected services (from reports): xstockstrat-indicators (consumer surfaces: xstockstrat-ui formula test, xstockstrat-agent test_formula)
- Root cause hypothesis: forgeable stderr substrings; memory accounting never implemented; `.get('result', {})` default
- Recommended design depth: full → `/sdd-design fix-sandbox-result-contract` (rationale: SEV-2 plus a live proto-deprecation option for memory_used_bytes and a formula-contract decision (Open Question 1); consumer surfaces read the result)
- Development branch: feature/fix-sandbox-result-contract
