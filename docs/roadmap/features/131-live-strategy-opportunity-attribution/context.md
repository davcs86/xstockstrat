## Session 2026-08-13T00:00:00Z — sdd-story

- Created feature.md (status: draft), product-spec.md, context.md from user story.
- Feature number assigned: 131 (created immediately after 130-signal-source-reliability-weight in
  the same session — recomputed `max(NNN)+1` fresh before this directory, not reused from a stale
  count).
- Story originated from conversational design-scouting. The user's initial framing — "all symbols
  are evaluated against all live strategies in the live loop" — was corrected during scouting:
  `strategy_symbols()` (`live_loop.py:37-47`) shows each live-enabled strategy evaluates only its
  own explicit `signal_params.symbols` list; strategies with no symbols are skipped entirely. The
  product spec is written against the corrected mechanism, not the original framing.
- Confirmed by direct code read (not docs): `main.py` constructs `live_loop` and never hands the
  servicer a reference to it (`servicer._live_loop` does not exist, unlike
  `servicer._fundsignal_loop = fundsignal_loop` at `main.py:149`) — so reaching into the live loop's
  private in-memory state was ruled out as the FR-5 direction before design even started; an
  independent re-trace (mirroring the existing watchlist-attribution pattern) was chosen as the
  scoped approach instead. This is recorded as a design constraint in the spec (FR-5), not left for
  `/sdd-design` to rediscover.
- Confirmed no proto change is needed: `Opportunity.provenance` (`analysis.proto:458`) is already
  `repeated string`, so a new `"live_strategy"` origin tag needs no proto edit.
- Ledger checked (fails.md/insights.md): flagged the 023-position-sizing-engine
  ordinal-vs-cardinal `Opportunity.conviction` trap in Open Questions as a guardrail, though this
  feature does not touch the conviction formula itself.

## Session 2026-08-13T00:10:00Z — sdd-review product-spec

- Product spec approved. Status: draft → spec-ready.
- Criteria verdict: PASS WITH WARNINGS. Warnings: (1) both Open Questions remain unchecked —
  reviewer judged both legitimately deferred to `/sdd-design` rather than spec gaps, but recommends
  making OQ1's deferral as explicit as OQ2's phrasing already is; (2) FR-2's citation
  (`servicer.py:2144-2168`, labeled "attribution/trace step") covers only the attribution/provenance
  code — the actual `evaluate_conditions_traced` call is at `servicer.py:2205-2209`; tighten this
  citation at `/sdd-spec` time (C-01); (3) AC-2/AC-6 are qualitative rather than quantitative —
  acceptable per the criteria's WARN allowance, but design/spec phase should pin down exact test
  assertions.
- Overlap findings: none. Confirmed CLEAN against all 9 other active-status features scanned;
  `125-unified-symbol-page` shares `xstockstrat-analysis` and even reads `ListOpportunities`, but
  only as a read-only consumer — it never touches `_compute_opportunities` or `StrategiesRepository`.
