## Status History

| Date | Status | Updated by | Note |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-05-12 | `idea` → `draft` | /sdd-story | Product spec generated |
| 2026-05-12 | `draft` → `spec-ready` | /sdd-review | Product spec approved (4 warnings: feature overlaps with 002, 003, 004, 005 — all advisory) |
| 2026-05-12 | `spec-ready` → `implementation-ready` | /sdd-spec | Implementation spec generated with 4 steps. Key findings: feature 005 provides nginx.conf + Dockerfile on feature/frontend-reverse-proxy branch; Steps 1–2 update DO app specs (remove frontend http_port, add nginx on port 80); Step 3 creates docker-entrypoint.sh for envsubst templating of DO private URLs; Step 4 documents nginx in CLAUDE.md. |
| 2026-05-18 | `implementation-ready` → `in-progress` | /sdd-execute | Step 1 done: added xstockstrat-nginx service (http_port: 80) to .do/app.dev.yaml; removed http_port from trader, insights, config-ui. |
| 2026-05-18 | `in-progress` → `code-completed` | /sdd-execute | All 4 steps done. Step 4: added Nginx Reverse Proxy section to CLAUDE.md and Nginx config row to Key File Paths Reference table. |
| 2026-05-18 | `code-completed` → `launched` | production promotion | Merged to main via commit 4ed76c3; now live in production |

## Artifacts

- [Product Spec](product-spec.md) — requirements and governance
- [Implementation Spec](implementation-spec.md) — 4 steps with concrete DO app spec changes and docker-entrypoint.sh script
- [Context Log](context.md) — session history, decisions, deviations

## Summary

Wire the nginx reverse proxy (established locally by feature 005-frontend-reverse-proxy) into the DigitalOcean App Platform deployment by updating `.do/app.yaml` and `.do/app.dev.yaml` so that the unified `/trader`, `/insights`, `/config-ui` routing is live in both dev and production environments.

## Reviewers

_(Auto-populated from docs/runbooks/reviewer-registry.md based on affected services and
change types. Override as needed for this feature. Snapshot finalized at /sdd-spec time —
re-run /sdd-spec if the registry changes.)_

| Role | Review Focus |
|---|---|
| Platform Lead | Port uniqueness, service registry consistency, inter-service dependency graph correctness |
| `xstockstrat-trader` service owner | Trading UI correctness, Connect-RPC call safety, no direct DB access from frontend |
| `xstockstrat-insights` service owner | Analytics display accuracy, SSE polling resilience, read-only access pattern |
| `xstockstrat-config-ui` service owner | Config mutation safety, environment scope correctness, no secret values rendered in UI |

## Next Action

`/sdd-review do-nginx-integration impl-spec` — validate implementation spec for quality and overlap, then `/sdd-execute do-nginx-integration` to begin execution
