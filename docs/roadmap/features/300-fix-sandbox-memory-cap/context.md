## Session 2026-10-15 (/sdd-triage)

- Bug recorded as `docs/reports/2026-10-15-indicators-sandbox-memory-cap-not-enforced-defect.md` (Issues disabled). Found by feature 228's post-deploy O-3 dev smoke on staging.
- Severity: SEV-2 (dev observed). Routed to the SDD path (Track C).
- Created: feature.md, product-spec.md (including the Consumer Surface(s) section, a lesson from 228's review),
  acceptance.feature (2 regression scenarios), context.md.
- Affected services: xstockstrat-indicators.
- Root cause hypothesis: the DO runtime accepts but does not enforce `RLIMIT_DATA` (e.g. gVisor). Unconfirmed.
- Production exposure: probably affected (same platform). Not escalated to Track A because production was not
  observed. Noted for the operator.
- Recommended design depth: quick → `/sdd-design fix-sandbox-memory-cap quick`. Rationale: SEV-2, single service, root cause not yet
  confirmed.
- Development branch: feature/fix-sandbox-memory-cap.
