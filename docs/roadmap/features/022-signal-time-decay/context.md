## Session 2026-05-26T00:00:00Z — sdd-story

- Created feature.md (status: draft), product-spec.md, context.md from user story.
- Feature number assigned: 022.
- No proto or schema changes. Single config key + analysis scoring loop change.
- Key design decision captured: use `ingested_at` (not source publication time) as age reference.
- Two open questions deferred to /sdd-spec: age reference confirmation, and whether to add a max-age floor to drop ancient signals entirely.
