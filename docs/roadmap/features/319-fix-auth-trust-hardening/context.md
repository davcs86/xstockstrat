## Session 2026-11-10 (/sdd-triage)

- Bug reported via defect reports (clustered triage):
  - docs/reports/2026-10-20-config-setconfig-internal-caller-no-peersan-defect.md (SEV-2)
  - docs/reports/2026-10-19-identity-revoketoken-unverified-decode-defect.md (SEV-3)
  - docs/reports/2026-10-29-agent-dcr-fail-closed-defect.md (SEV-2, security posture)
- Cluster rationale: all three are auth edges that trust unverified input (header without peer SAN, unsigned JWT,
  unknown policy treated as permissive) — one security-hardening review.
- Severity: SEV-2 (highest of cluster)
- Routed to SDD path (Track C); prod-impacting SEV-2 routed to C by operator decision 2026-11-10
- Created: status.md, feature.md, product-spec.md, acceptance.feature (3 regression scenarios), context.md
- Affected services (from reports): xstockstrat-config, xstockstrat-trading, xstockstrat-identity, xstockstrat-agent
- Root cause hypothesis: feature-102 grant lacks peerSan; identity uses jwt.decode; agent DCR reads are best-effort
  fail-open (feature 247 FR-2/AC-4).
- **Open decision carried forward:** the operator earlier kept agent-dcr-fail-closed open pending a fail-closed
  security-posture decision. Recorded as product-spec Open Question 1; it overrides feature 247 FR-2/AC-4 and needs
  explicit operator sign-off recorded here before design concludes. AC-3 assumes fail-closed.
- Recommended design depth: full → `/sdd-design fix-auth-trust-hardening` (rationale: SEV-2, security posture, 4 affected services)
- Development branch: feature/fix-auth-trust-hardening

## Session 2026-11-10 — sdd-review product-spec

- Product spec approved. Status: draft → spec-ready.
- Warnings: bug-template conventions (no FR-N/@FR tags; no Consumer Surface section); OQ1 (fail-closed DCR) needs operator sign-off before design concludes — AC-3 provisional and supersedes feature 247 FR-2/AC-4; trading poller SAN needs an acceptance line
- Overlap findings: WARN: configServiceImpl.ts shared with 314; agent shared with 314/322/328/331
- Recommended design depth: full (security posture; config/trading/identity/agent)
- Tree: ccr-500a9eb9-nvk45x (origin/main-dev 0fecb24d + triage/docs commits; no feature branch yet)

## Session 2026-11-10 (operator decisions before /sdd-design)

- Operator signed off **fail-closed DCR**: `/oauth/register` returns 503 and issues no client_id when `oauth.registration_enabled` or `oauth.allowed_redirect_uris` cannot be read. Supersedes feature 247 FR-2/AC-4 (201 on a stall) — `/sdd-design` marks that promoted scenario superseded (C-16). Identity-side allowlist enforcement is not in scope.
- AC-3 precondition reworded: since feature 295 the policy is read from the WatchConfig snapshot, so a GetConfig stall no longer causes a read failure; the failing case is a missing/unreadable snapshot.

## Session 2026-11-11 — sdd-batch design gate (round 2)

`/sdd-design fix-auth-trust-hardening` (full) is halted at its approval gate after round 2 (gate policy: halt).
design.md is not written and status.md is unchanged. Register: `debate.md` (D-1..D-12, R-1..R-10, O-1..O-4).

## Open Threads

- **Approach:** the round-1 Steps 1–4 stand (D-1..D-8).
  - Step 1, config: the SetConfig poller grant is bound to peerSan `xstockstrat-trading`, and caller_identity is persisted only when the grant authorizes the call.
  - Step 2, identity: RevokeToken calls `jwt.verify` with ignoreExpiration and HS256 pinned. An unverifiable token is ignored with success:true.
  - Step 3, agent: DCR fails closed with 503 when no snapshot is readable.
  - Step 4: docs and the C-16 amendments.
  - Round 2 adds the label-free counter `identity.revoke.unverifiable` (D-9). It increments only in the verify-catch, is registered in telemetryAllowlist MIN_INSTRUMENTS and drive(), and is asserted as an And on 319 @AC-2. Round 2 also adds a fixed, PII-free WARN (D-10).
  - Evidence shows that DO leaf certs carry DNS SAN = service name: do-render-app-spec.py `mint` runs gen-dev-certs.sh:50 (D-11).
  - The O-1 rejection fallback is corrected: if the operator rejects the amendments, Step 1 is deferred out of 319 (D-12).
- **Strongest open objection (O-1, blocking, C-16):** the operator must explicitly sign off the in-place @feature-319 Given amendments to config @AC-2/241, @AC-5/296 and @AC-25/295 (the SAN-bound poller success path). The sign-off goes in this file before design concludes. Rejecting means Step 1 is deferred, and no variant lands the code while the scenarios stay unamended.
- **Also open:**
  - O-3 (non-blocking, same operator prompt): confirm the OQ3 resolution (ignore, success:true, no UPDATE, WARN plus the counter).
  - O-4 (non-blocking): confirm the homelab leaf SAN render path before Step 1 merges.
  - O-2 closed in round 2.
- **Floor status:** no breaches.
- **Uncovered @AC changes (no operator decision yet):**
  - EXTEND 319:@AC-1 and 319:@AC-2;
  - CHANGE config:@AC-2/241, @AC-5/296 and @AC-25/295;
  - EXTEND identity:@AC-52;
  - PRESERVE @AC-54, identity:@AC-41 and @AC-47.
  - Covered by the 2026-11-10 operator decision: 319:@AC-3 and agent:@AC-4/247.

  "round": 2,
  "synth": {
    "approach": "The round-1 synthesis stands: Steps 1–4 resting on D-1..D-8. This round adds only what is needed to close O-2 and to correct the O-1 fallback.\n\nSTEP 1: CONFIG. Unchanged (D-1, D-2, D-3).\n- Pre-merge cert precondition, now mostly closed by evidence:\n  - Deployed leaves are not hand-minted. scripts/do-render-app-spec.py:39-70 (`mint`) decodes the env CA through mtls-provision.sh (:44) and runs scripts/gen-dev-certs.sh (:53-62) on every render.\n  - gen-dev-certs.sh:50 emits `subjectAltName = DNS:${svc}`, so DO staging and prod trading leaves carry DNS SAN xstockstrat-trading.\n  - Live corroboration: the GetSecret grant `peerSan: 'xstockstrat-marketdata'` (authz.ts:141) already passes in production at marketdata startup.\n  - The one residual pre-merge check is homelab only, and only if its leaf render path differs (inter-service-mtls-rollout.md:33-34 says the CA is shared; the leaf path is unconfirmed). Step 1 lists it as a check, not a code change.\n\nSTEP 2: IDENTITY. D-4 as before, plus one OTel counter.\n(a) Counter definition. In services/xstockstrat-identity/src/telemetry.ts, next to the existing failure counters (:340-374), add:\n- `const revokeUnverifiable = new BoundCounter('identity.revoke.unverifiable', { description: 'RevokeToken calls ignored because the token failed signature verification (forged, malformed, or pre-rotation)' })`\n- `export function recordRevokeUnverifiable(): void { revokeUnverifiable.add(1); }`\n- The counter has no labels.\n(b) Where it increments. revokeToken's inner verify-catch calls recordRevokeUnverifiable() next to the WARN.\n- The missing-JWT_SECRET path does not increment it. That path stays code 13 through the outer catch, with the existing validateFailures{secret_missing} as its signal.\n(c) The WARN. It is the fixed message 'RevokeToken: unverifiable token ignored', optionally with the verify error class name.\n- No token, decoded payload or user_id goes into it (identity CLAUDE.md Observability rule).\n- A test asserts the WARN fields.\n(d) Allowlist test, services/xstockstrat-identity/src/__tests__/telemetryAllowlist.test.ts. Both edits are now concrete (verified this round: MIN_INSTRUMENTS at :31-38, drive() at :41-49):\n- add 'identity.revoke.unverifiable' to MIN_INSTRUMENTS;\n- add telemetry.recordRevokeUnverifiable() to drive().\nThis puts the new instrument under the closed-label/forbidden-key gate.\n(e) Counter test, using src/__tests__/fixtures/collectingReader.ts:\n- the counter rises by 1 for AC-2's unsigned-token call;\n- it rises by 0 for the expired-but-signed call.\n(f) Identity CLAUDE.md:\n- add the instrument to the Observability instruments line;\n- add one constraint: it is not a forgery signal on its own, because a JWT_SECRET rotation makes legitimate logouts of pre-rotation tokens increment it.\n(g) Acceptance (C-15). 319 acceptance.feature @AC-2 gains: `And the identity.revoke.unverifiable counter increases by 1 for the unsigned call and by 0 for the expired-signed call`. C-16 launch promotion then carries this into services/xstockstrat-identity/acceptance/signal-map-instrumentation.feature, alongside the sibling instruments pinned at @AC-52.\n\nSTEP 3: AGENT. Unchanged (D-5, D-6, D-7).\n\nSTEP 4: DOCS AND C-16 AMENDMENTS. Unchanged (D-8).\n- The config @AC-2/241, @AC-5/296 and @AC-25/295 Given amendments (\"from an mTLS peer with DNS SAN `xstockstrat-trading`\"; the Thens are unchanged) stay BLOCKED on the operator.\n\nOPERATOR GATE. One prompt from the orchestrator, recorded in context.md before design concludes. It covers:\n(a) the exact in-place @feature-319 Given amendment text for the three config scenarios;\n(b) the OQ3 resolution: ignore, success:true, no UPDATE, WARN plus identity.revoke.unverifiable.\n\nCorrected fallback (C-16, fails.md 2026-11-04):\n- Rejecting (a) means rejecting the SAN-bound success path. The only coherent outcomes are: sign off the amendment, or defer Step 1 out of this feature (Steps 2–4 proceed).\n- There is no third path in which the code changes but the durable scenarios stay unamended or are marked superseded.\n- Rejecting (b) leaves only a rejecting-error design, which is R-5. Only the operator can reopen R-5.\n\nStep order: unchanged. Step 1 goes harness-green, then RED AC-1, then the grant flip. Steps 2 and 3 are independent.",
